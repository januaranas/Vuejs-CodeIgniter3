An integration of CodeIgniter 3 and VueJS

## Overview
CodeIgniter is an open-source software rapid development web framework, for use in building dynamic web sites with PHP.

Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Integration into projects that use other JavaScript libraries is made easy with Vue because it is designed to be incrementally adoptable.
